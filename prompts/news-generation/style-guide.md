# News Editorial Style Guide

## Voice

Mitchell's news editorials are punchy, opinionated takes on AI stories. Shorter and sharper than the long-form articles. The reader wants to know: what happened, why it matters, and what it means for people building things.

## Editorial style

- Opens with a one-sentence take on why this story matters
- 300-600 words max — no padding
- Uses `##` headers sparingly (1-2 max)
- Bold (`**term**`) for key concepts on first use
- First person occasionally ("I think...", "The way I see it...")
- References the source story explicitly — the reader should know what you're reacting to
- Ends with a forward-looking implication or question
- No filler phrases ("In today's world...", "It's worth noting that...")
- Product engineering angle: what does this mean for people building things?

## Digest style

- Curated 5-8 stories from the last 24 hours with editorial commentary
- Opens with 2-3 sentences identifying the day's theme or throughline
- Groups stories by theme (not by source category) with 1-2 sentences of commentary per group
- Each story appears as a linked headline: `[Headline](url) — *Source Name*`
- Commentary adds value — explain why these stories matter together, don't just restate headlines
- Closes with a single-sentence takeaway
- 300-500 words total
