# News Editorial Style Guide

## Voice

Mitchell's news editorials are punchy, opinionated takes on AI stories. Shorter and sharper than the long-form articles. The reader wants to know: what happened, why it matters, and what it means for people building things.

## Editorial style

- Opens with a one-sentence take on why this story matters
- 300-600 words max — no padding
- Uses `##` headers sparingly (1-2 max)
- Bold (`**term**`) for key concepts on first use
- First person occasionally ("I think...", "The way I see it...")
- References the source story explicitly — the reader should know what you're reacting to
- Ends with a forward-looking implication or question
- No filler phrases ("In today's world...", "It's worth noting that...")
- Product engineering angle: what does this mean for people building things?

## Digest style

- Curated 5-8 stories from the last 24 hours with editorial commentary
- Opens with 2-3 sentences identifying the day's theme or throughline
- Groups stories by theme (not by source category) with 1-2 sentences of commentary per group
- Each story appears as a linked headline: `[Headline](url) — *Source Name*`
- Commentary adds value — explain why these stories matter together, don't just restate headlines
- Closes with a single-sentence takeaway
- 300-500 words total

## Language — British English (en-GB)

All content must use British English spelling and conventions:

- **-ise** not -ize (organise, optimise, recognise, summarise, analyse, prioritise)
- **-our** not -or (colour, labour, behaviour, favour, honour)
- **-re** not -er (centre, metre, fibre)
- **-ence** not -ense (licence noun, defence, offence)
- **-lled/-lling** not -led/-ling (modelling, travelling, labelled, fulfil)
- **Dates:** day month year — "21 Feb 2026", never "Feb 21, 2026"
- **Headings:** Sentence case, not Title Case — "The economics of delegation", not "The Economics of Delegation"
- **Exception:** Keep American spelling when quoting named American concepts or external headlines

## Anti-AI-tell rules

### Banned vocabulary

Never use these words — they signal AI-generated text:

additionally, crucial, delve, enhance, foster, garner, groundbreaking, landscape, nestled, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, testament, underscore, vibrant, vital role

### Banned structures

- "serves as" / "stands as" — just say what it is
- "not just X — it's Y" — find a less formulaic construction
- Rule of three lists used repeatedly — vary list lengths
- Em dash overuse — one per piece maximum
- Sycophantic openers ("Great question!", "Absolutely!")
- Generic conclusions ("As we look to the future...", "Only time will tell...")
- Vague attribution ("experts say", "many believe", "it's widely recognised")
- Superficial -ing verb phrases ("leveraging AI", "harnessing the power of")
- Synonym cycling (using a different word for the same thing every sentence)

### Filler phrases to cut

"It's worth noting that", "In today's world", "At the end of the day", "Let's dive in", "Without further ado"

| Structure  | Multiple sections  | 1-2 sections max |
| References | Frameworks, theory | Specific story   |
| Opening    | Conceptual framing | Direct reaction  |
