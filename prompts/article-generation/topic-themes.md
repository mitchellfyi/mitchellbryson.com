# Topic Themes

Content is always AI-related. Focus on high-level concepts grounded in real-world examples, opinionated from a product engineering perspective, and philosophical in nature.

## Allowed categories

- **AI economics and market structure** — what happens to pricing, competition, and value capture when AI commoditises execution
- **Agent architecture and autonomy** — trust boundaries, delegation patterns, agent-to-agent protocols, principal-agent problems
- **The philosophy of AI decision-making** — judgment vs computation, what "understanding" means for machines, when AI should and shouldn't decide
- **Product engineering with AI** — when to use AI vs traditional code, build vs buy, architecture tradeoffs, shipping AI features
- **Governance, trust, and accountability** — regulation, compliance, audit trails, liability when agents act autonomously
- **Future of work and organisational design** — how teams, firms, and roles change with AI, the economics of human-agent collaboration
- **AI infrastructure and operational patterns** — RAG in practice, cost of running AI at scale, vendor lock-in, LLMOps, maintenance architecture
- **Emerging capabilities and their second-order effects** — what new AI capabilities mean for products and society, not just demos

## Angle guidance

- Find the non-obvious take. If everyone is talking about a topic, find the angle they're missing.
- Prefer "what does this mean for how we build things" over "isn't this cool technology."
- Ground every claim in a specific example: a company, a product, a number, a mechanism.
- Think like a product engineer who reads economics papers and philosophy.
