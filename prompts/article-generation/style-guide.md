# Writing Style Guide

## Voice

Mitchell writes about AI from the intersection of product engineering, economics, and philosophy. The tone is direct, opinionated, and grounded. Every claim earns its place with a specific example, mechanism, or number. No hand-waving.

## Published article style

- Opens with a crisp framing of the core insight — no throat-clearing
- Uses `##` and `###` headers to structure the argument
- Bold (`**term**`) for key concepts on first use
- Bullet lists for parallel items, numbered lists for sequences
- First person occasionally ("I think...", "The way I see it...")
- References frameworks: Coase, game theory, principal-agent, transaction costs
- Includes specific numbers, companies, and products as evidence
- Titles often use a colon pattern: "Main Concept: Subtitle"
- Ends with a forward-looking implication or open question, not a summary
- Target length: 1000-1800 words
- No filler phrases ("In today's world...", "It's worth noting that...")

### Example opening

"Delegation has always been the fundamental economic act of scaling human output. When cognitive labour becomes infinitely delegable to AI agents, the economics of everything changes."

### Example section

"**Articulation** - The ability to specify what you want with enough precision that agents can execute. Prompt engineering is the trivial version. Real articulation is: goals, constraints, success criteria, edge cases, values. The people who can articulate well become the new bottleneck."

## Language — British English (en-GB)

All content must use British English spelling and conventions:

- **-ise** not -ize (organise, optimise, recognise, summarise, analyse, prioritise)
- **-our** not -or (colour, labour, behaviour, favour, honour)
- **-re** not -er (centre, metre, fibre)
- **-ence** not -ense (licence noun, defence, offence)
- **-lled/-lling** not -led/-ling (modelling, travelling, labelled, fulfil)
- **Dates:** day month year — "21 Feb 2026", never "Feb 21, 2026"
- **Headings:** Sentence case, not Title Case — "The economics of delegation", not "The Economics of Delegation"
- **Exception:** Keep American spelling when quoting named American concepts (e.g. "data as labor" from AEA literature, specific US programme names)

## Anti-AI-tell rules

### Banned vocabulary

Never use these words — they signal AI-generated text:

additionally, crucial, delve, enhance, foster, garner, groundbreaking, landscape, nestled, pivotal, showcase, tapestry, testament, underscore, vibrant, vital role

### Banned structures

- "serves as" / "stands as" — just say what it is
- "not just X — it's Y" — find a less formulaic construction
- Rule of three lists ("X, Y, and Z") used repeatedly — vary list lengths
- Em dash overuse — one per article maximum
- Sycophantic openers ("Great question!", "Absolutely!")
- Generic conclusions ("As we look to the future...", "Only time will tell...")
- Vague attribution ("experts say", "many believe", "it's widely recognised")
- Superficial -ing verb phrases ("leveraging AI", "harnessing the power of")
- Synonym cycling (using a different word for the same thing every sentence to sound varied)

### Filler phrases to cut

"It's worth noting that", "In today's world", "At the end of the day", "In this article we will", "Let's dive in", "Without further ado"

## Draft style

Drafts are raw thinking notes. They read like someone working through an idea in a text editor late at night.

- Lowercase, minimal punctuation
- Sentence fragments and bullet-point thinking
- No markdown headers (those come in polish)
- No frontmatter
- Core ideas without polish or transitions
- Reads like notes-to-self, not prose

### Example draft

```
delegation is the fundamental economic act of scaling human output
what happens when cognitive labor becomes infinitely delegable
cost drops to near zero
constraint shifts to articulation and judgment

coasean boundary dissolves
coase theory of the firm
companies exist because internal coordination cheaper than market transactions
when agents execute at near zero marginal cost calculation flips
why employ team when you can delegate to agents on demand
firm becomes mission specification engine not labor coordination engine
```

### Another draft example

```
agents doing real work in economy - negotiating contracts making purchases entering commitments
infrastructure assumes humanity - credit checks business references contract law reputation systems
all presumes person or registered entity on other side
need a trust stack for agents

question isnt whether agents should have trust properties - they already do implicitly
question is whether we make those properties explicit verifiable enforceable before gaps cause harm
```
