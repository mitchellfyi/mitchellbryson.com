# Organic Traffic & Discoverability Ideas

### Publish more frequently on topics people search for
18 articles is a solid base but the site will grow fastest by targeting specific search queries. Think "how to" and "what is" content around your expertise: "how to add AI to a Rails app", "n8n vs make for AI workflows", "Claude Code vs Cursor for coding". Comparison and tutorial posts attract search traffic consistently.

### Internal linking from articles to uses/projects
Articles discuss AI uses and systems but don't link to `/uses/` or `/projects/` pages. Cross-linking strengthens topical authority and distributes page rank.

### Comparison/guide content for the uses section
Pages like "Best AI coding uses 2026" or "Claude Code vs Cursor: which is better?" are high-intent search queries. Already have the tool data — create a few comparison articles that link back to individual tool pages.

### Case study articles tied to Barnsley AI
"How we automated document processing for a Barnsley manufacturing firm" — even hypothetical walkthroughs that show your process would rank for local + industry queries and build trust.

### Submit to aggregators and directories
- uses.tech — submit your /uses or /uses page
- IndieHackers, HackerNews — share articles
- AI tool directories — list your projects (launchonomy, pitchplease, lofield.fm)
- dev.to / hashnode — cross-post articles with canonical pointing back to your site

### Add a newsletter archive page
If you're collecting subscribers, published editions become indexable content.

### Programmatic local pages
If Barnsley AI performs well, consider expanding to nearby towns (Sheffield, Wakefield, Doncaster) with the same template. Each gets its own set of pages.
