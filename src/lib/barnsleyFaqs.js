    question: 'What does an AI consultant actually do?',
    answer:
      'An AI consultant helps businesses identify where artificial intelligence can save time or money, then builds and integrates those systems. This ranges from automating repetitive tasks like data entry and email triage, to building AI-powered search, chatbots, or document processing pipelines tailored to your workflow.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does AI development cost for a small UK business?',
    answer:
      'Costs vary depending on scope. A focused automation or chatbot project can start from a few thousand pounds, while larger integrations involving multiple systems take more investment. I offer flexible engagement models — from one-off builds to ongoing support — so we can find something that fits your budget.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to implement an AI solution?',
    answer:
      'Simple automations and chatbots can be live within two to four weeks. More complex projects involving custom model training, multi-system integrations, or large datasets typically take six to twelve weeks. I always start with a scoping session to give you a realistic timeline before any work begins.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need technical knowledge to work with an AI developer?',
    answer:
      'No. I work with business owners and teams at all technical levels. I handle the technical side and explain everything in plain language. You just need to know your business processes and where the pain points are — I take care of the rest.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is my data safe when using AI?',
    answer:
      'Data safety is a priority in every project. I follow UK GDPR requirements and build systems that keep your data within approved environments. Where possible, I use on-premise or private cloud deployments so sensitive information never leaves your control. We discuss data handling in detail before any project starts.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can AI integrate with the tools I already use?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Most AI solutions are built to work alongside your existing software — whether that is a CRM, accounting package, inventory system, or internal database. I specialise in connecting AI capabilities to the tools businesses already rely on, so you get the benefits without replacing your current setup.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which areas do you serve?',
    answer:
      'I am based in Barnsley and work with businesses across South Yorkshire, including Sheffield, Wakefield, Rotherham, Doncaster, Huddersfield, and Leeds. I also work remotely with clients across the UK, so location is rarely a barrier.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do I know if AI is right for my business?',
    answer:
      'AI works best when you have repetitive tasks, large volumes of data to process, or customer interactions that could be handled faster. If your team spends hours on manual data entry, answering the same questions, or searching through documents, AI can likely help. I offer a free initial conversation to assess whether AI is a good fit.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What industries do you work with?',
    answer:
      'I work across a range of sectors including manufacturing, e-commerce, healthcare, professional services, education, and logistics. South Yorkshire has a strong mix of traditional and digital businesses, and AI can add value in almost any industry where manual processes slow things down.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens after an AI system is built?',
    answer:
      'After deployment, I provide documentation and training so your team can use the system confidently. I also offer ongoing support and maintenance packages to keep things running smoothly, handle updates, and make improvements as your needs evolve.',
  },
