Creating technology to empower civilians to explore space on their own terms.

## Overview

Planetaria is a revolutionary platform that democratizes space exploration by providing civilians with the tools and technology needed to explore space independently. Our mission is to make space accessible to everyone, not just government agencies and large corporations.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Advanced AI-powered navigation systems that can handle complex space missions
- **Modular Design**: Flexible spacecraft architecture that can be customized for different mission requirements
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive telemetry and monitoring systems for mission control
- **Cost-effective Solutions**: Affordable space technology that makes exploration accessible

## Technology Stack

- **React** for the mission control dashboard
- **Node.js** for backend systems
- **Python** for AI and machine learning algorithms
- **Rust** for performance-critical flight systems
- **WebAssembly** for real-time calculations

## Impact

Since launching, Planetaria has enabled over 50 civilian space missions, ranging from satellite deployments to deep space exploration. Our technology has been adopted by universities, research institutions, and private space companies worldwide.

## Future Plans

We're currently working on:

1. **Interplanetary Missions**: Expanding our capabilities to support missions to Mars and beyond
2. **AI Co-pilot**: Developing advanced AI systems to assist with complex mission planning
3. **Space Tourism**: Creating safe and reliable systems for civilian space travel
