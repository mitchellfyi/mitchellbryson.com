The schematics for the first rocket I designed that successfully made it to orbit.

## Overview

OpenShuttle represents a breakthrough in open-source space technology. This project contains the complete schematics, designs, and documentation for a fully functional orbital launch vehicle, making space access more accessible to researchers, universities, and space enthusiasts worldwide.

## Design Philosophy

OpenShuttle was designed with the following principles:

- **Open Source**: All designs and documentation are freely available
- **Modularity**: Components can be built and tested independently
- **Safety First**: Multiple redundant safety systems
- **Educational**: Designed to be a learning platform for aerospace engineering

## Technical Specifications

### Dimensions
- **Length**: 45 meters
- **Diameter**: 3.7 meters
- **Mass**: 85,000 kg (fully fueled)
- **Payload Capacity**: 2,500 kg to LEO

### Propulsion
- **First Stage**: 9 Merlin-style engines (liquid oxygen/RP-1)
- **Second Stage**: 1 vacuum-optimized engine
- **Thrust**: 7,600 kN at sea level
- **Specific Impulse**: 282 seconds (sea level), 311 seconds (vacuum)

### Guidance & Control
- **Navigation**: GPS + inertial navigation system
- **Control**: Thrust vectoring + grid fins
