The operating system that powers our Planetaria space shuttles.

## Overview

cosmOS is a specialized operating system designed specifically for space missions. Built from the ground up to handle the unique challenges of space travel, it provides reliable, fault-tolerant computing for critical spacecraft operations.

## Key Features

- **Fault Tolerance**: Designed to handle cosmic radiation and hardware failures
- **Real-time Processing**: Guaranteed response times for critical operations
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to customize for different mission requirements
- **Space-hardened**: Tested in extreme conditions and radiation environments

## Architecture

cosmOS uses a microkernel architecture with the following components:

- **Kernel**: Core system services and hardware abstraction
- **Device Drivers**: Specialized drivers for space hardware
- **Mission Control**: High-level mission management and coordination
- **Safety Systems**: Redundant safety and emergency protocols

## Mission Critical Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: AI-powered navigation systems
- **Life Support Integration**: Monitoring and control of life support systems
- **Communication Management**: Reliable communication with mission control
- **Emergency Protocols**: Automated emergency response systems

## Development

Built using modern systems programming practices:

- **Rust** for memory safety and performance
- **C** for low-level hardware interfaces
- **Assembly** for critical timing-sensitive operations
- **Formal Verification** for safety-critical components

## Testing

cosmOS undergoes rigorous testing including:

- **Radiation Testing**: Exposed to cosmic radiation simulation
- **Temperature Cycling**: Tested in extreme temperature ranges
- **Vibration Testing**: Validated for launch conditions
- **Long-duration Testing**: Continuous operation for months
