whatsapp is where customers already are
so why not meet them there with AI support

the idea is to build a whatsapp support agent
that can handle common questions
escalate to humans when needed
and keep full audit trails of everything

key features
fast first response
under 60 seconds
seamless handoff to humans
with full context
audit trail for every decision
routing based on customer priority
and SLA requirements
ability to deflect simple questions
without blocking escalation

the architecture would be
whatsapp webhook receives messages
gateway filters and authenticates customers
natural language understanding figures out what they want
knowledge base and tools provide answers
response builder formats the reply
human handoff service manages escalations
everything gets logged for audit

you'd start with simple FAQ responses
and gradually add more complex capabilities
like order lookup
refund processing
etc

the goal is to handle routine support automatically while making it easy for humans to take over when needed
