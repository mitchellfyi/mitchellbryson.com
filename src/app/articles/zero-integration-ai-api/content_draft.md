what if AI agents could automatically figure out
how to connect two companies' systems
without humans having to do all the integration work

the idea is that agents would
look at both companies' APIs
look at both companies' data formats
figure out how to map between them
generate the code to make them talk to each other
test that it actually works
keep it working when either side changes

right now when companies want to work together
it takes weeks or months of back and forth
about field mappings
about data formats
about error handling
etc
it's mostly mechanical work
that could be automated

you'd start with something simple
like exchanging orders
or invoices
between two companies that already have decent APIs

the agents would learn each system
propose a shared format
generate the translation code
and prove it works with real data

if it works
you could expand to more partners
and more complex integrations

the goal is to make business partnerships as easy as "here's my API" "here's what I want to exchange" "make it work"
