you don't need a six month project
to prove AI works
just run a tight 10 day pilot

pick one specific thing
like "where is my order"
or "check this invoice"
and test it with a small group of users

set clear targets upfront
what metric are you trying to improve
by how much
and what's the stop threshold
if it goes wrong

wire up the data
add some basic guardrails
and ship it to maybe 10-20% of your traffic

measure everything daily
if quality drops
roll back immediately
if costs get too high
roll back immediately

after 10 days you should have a clear answer
does this work
is it worth scaling
what would it take to run it properly

the key is keeping it simple
and having a clear exit strategy
if it doesn't work
