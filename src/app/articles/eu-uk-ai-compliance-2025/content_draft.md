the EU AI Act is coming into force
over the next few years
and if you're already following UK data protection rules
you're halfway there

the key dates
feb 2025: some prohibited uses start
like scraping faces for recognition
aug 2025: governance requirements kick in
documentation
transparency
aug 2026: most other requirements apply
risk management
monitoring
aug 2027: some high-risk systems get extra time

if you're already doing the UK ICO's AI risk toolkit
you've got most of the controls you need
the EU rules are basically the same concepts
with different names

the main things you need to do
document your AI systems properly
assess risks
assess impacts
monitor for problems
report incidents
be transparent about what you're doing

this isn't about stopping innovation
it's about doing AI responsibly
if you're already thinking about bias
privacy
and safety
you're on the right track

start with your highest-risk systems and work backwards
most companies will only have a few systems that need the full treatment
