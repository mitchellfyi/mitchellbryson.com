what would a service agency look like
if it was run entirely by AI agents

the idea is to treat the company like a mission processor
clients give you goals
agents figure out strategies
allocate budgets
execute tasks
and deliver results

the workflow would be
mission intake: understand what the client wants to achieve
strategy compilation: break down the mission into specific tasks
and approaches
budget allocation: assign resources to different parts of the work
specialist agents: different AI agents handle different types of work
execution: agents do the actual work
quality assurance: check that the work meets standards
governance: make sure everything is being done properly
billing: track costs and charge appropriately

humans would still be in charge of
setting overall goals
and constraints
approving major decisions
handling exceptions
and edge cases
being accountable for outcomes

the key is having clear rules
about what agents can do
about what agents can't do
ways to monitor their work
and the ability to stop
or roll back
if something goes wrong

you'd start with simple well-defined services
and gradually expand
as the system proves it can handle more complexity
