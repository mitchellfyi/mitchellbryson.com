if AI does most of the work in the future
how do we distribute purchasing power
and access to AI capabilities

we already have some real-world examples
of basic income programs that work
finland's experiment showed improved wellbeing
without destroying employment
stockton's pilot actually increased full-time employment rates
kenya's long-term program is finding positive effects
on investment
and earnings

the money could come from
sovereign dividends from shared AI resources
like alaska's oil dividend
windfall sharing from AI profits
taxing extreme AI-driven profits
data-as-labor royalties
paying people for the data they contribute

but it's not just about cash
in an AI-first economy
access to powerful AI and compute
might be as important as money

so you might need
universal basic income in cash
universal basic compute credits for AI access
data dividends for people whose data trains the models

the key is designing systems
that distribute both purchasing power
and capability access fairly
without stifling innovation

you'd start with existing basic income pilots
and gradually expand them
as AI automation increases
