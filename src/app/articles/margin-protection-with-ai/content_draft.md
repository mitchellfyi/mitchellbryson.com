AI is most useful when it directly protects money
or makes money
here are three systems that usually pay for themselves quickly

dynamic pricing rules
automatically adjust prices based on costs
based on competition
based on inventory
but with clear limits
and human overrides

invoice checking
automatically verify that invoices match purchase orders
and price lists
before paying them
flagging discrepancies for human review

anomaly detection
automatically spot when margins are dropping
when costs are drifting
when conversion rates are changing unexpectedly

the key is to start with simple rules-based systems
rather than complex machine learning
you want something that's
easy to understand
and audit
fast to roll back if something goes wrong
clearly tied to business metrics

for pricing
use formulas with guardrails
rather than black box models
for invoice checking
compare against known good data
for anomalies
use statistical baselines
rather than trying to predict the future

the goal is to catch problems early and automatically not to replace human judgment entirely
