the UK economy is full of processes
that take way too long
property sales that drag on for months
hiring that takes weeks
accounting that takes days

these aren't problems of motivation
they're workflow problems
lots of documents
checks
handoffs
and missing data
that create bottlenecks

this is exactly what AI agents are good at
taking structured inputs
running rule-based checks
escalating when needed
and keeping audit trails

some obvious targets
conveyancing: property sales that take 12-20 weeks
could be compressed to days
with automated document processing
and search coordination
hiring: recruitment cycles of 5-7 weeks
could be cut dramatically
with automated screening
and matching
accounting: monthly closes that take 6+ days
could be automated
with reconciliation
and checking agents

the key insight is that these are all high-volume
rules-heavy processes
with lots of repetitive work
that humans find tedious
but AI can handle efficiently

you'd start with the most painful bottlenecks in each industry prove the concept works then expand to more complex workflows

the goal is to turn weeks of waiting into days of processing
