if you want AI agents to work autonomously
without losing control
you need a clear ladder
of what they're allowed to do
and when humans need to step in

the idea is to start with agents
that can only suggest things
then gradually give them more autonomy
as they prove they can handle it safely

here's a simple ladder
level 0: agents can only suggest actions
humans decide everything
level 1: agents can execute actions
but only after human approval
level 2: agents can act autonomously
within predefined boundaries
level 3: agents can act autonomously
and escalate when they're unsure
level 4: agents can act autonomously
and learn from their mistakes
level 5: agents can act autonomously
and set their own boundaries

at each level you need
clear rules about what the agent can do
clear rules about what the agent can't do
ways to monitor what it's doing
ways to stop it if something goes wrong
evidence that it's working safely
before you move to the next level

the key is earning autonomy through evidence
not just hoping it works
start conservative
and only move up when you have proof
the agent can handle it
