# Code Quality Rules

When writing or reviewing code, follow these principles:

## Core Principles

- **KISS** - Keep it simple; avoid unnecessary complexity
- **YAGNI** - Don't add features until needed
- **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself; extract shared logic
- **SOLID** - Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.

## Code Standards

- Functions should do one thing well
- Keep functions under 50 lines when possible
- Meaningful names over comments
- Handle errors explicitly
- No magic numbers or strings

## Before Committing

Ensure all quality gates pass:
- Linting passes
- Type checking passes (if applicable)
- Tests pass
- Build succeeds

## Reference
